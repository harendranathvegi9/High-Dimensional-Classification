  glmnet.m: fit an elasticnet model path
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  DESCRIPTION:
     Fit a regularization path for the elasticnet at a grid of values for
     the regularization parameter lambda. Can deal with all shapes of data.
     Fits linear, logistic and multinomial regression models.
 
  USAGE: 
     fit = glmnet(x, y)
     fit = glmnet(x, y, family, options)
 
  EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS:
  options         = glmnetSet;                  provided with glmnet.m
 
  INPUT ARGUMENTS:
  x           Input matrix, of dimension nobs x nvars; each row is an
              observation vector. Currently sparse format is NOT supported.
  y           Response variable. Quantitative for family =
              'gaussian'. For family = 'binomial' should be either a vector
              of two levels, or a two-column matrix of counts or
              proportions. For family = 'multinomial', can be either a
              vector of nc>=2 levels, or a matrix with nc columns of counts
              or proportions.
  family      Reponse type. (See above). Default is 'gaussian'. 
  options     A structure that may be set and altered by glmnetSet (type 
              help glmnetSet).
 
  OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
  fit         A structure.
  fit.a0      Intercept sequence of length length(fit.lambda). 
  fit.beta    For "elnet" and "lognet" models, a nvars x length(lambda) 
              matrix of coefficients. For "multnet", a list of nc such
              matrices, one for each class.
  fit.lambda  The actual sequence of lambda values used.
  fit.dev     The fraction of (null) deviance explained (for "elnet", this 
              is the R-square).
  fit.nulldev Null deviance (per observation).
  fit.df      The number of nonzero coefficients for each value of lambda.
              For "multnet", this is the number of variables with a nonzero
              coefficient for any class.
  fit.dfmat   For "multnet" only. A matrix consisting of the number of
              nonzero coefficients per class.
  fit.dim     Dimension of coefficient matrix (ices).
  fit.npasses Total passes over the data summed over all lambda values.
  fit.jerr    Error flag, for warnings and errors (largely for internal 
              debugging).
  fit.class   Type of regression - internal usage.
 
  DETAILS:
     The sequence of models implied by lambda is fit by coordinate descent.
     For family = 'gaussian' this is the lasso sequence if alpha = 1, else
     it is the elasticnet sequence. For family = 'binomial' or family =
     "multinomial", this is a lasso or elasticnet regularization path for
     fitting the linear logistic or multinomial logistic regression paths.
     Sometimes the sequence is truncated before options.nlambda values of
     lambda have been used, because of instabilities in the logistic or
     multinomial models near a saturated fit. glmnet(..., family =
     'binomial') fits a traditional logistic regression model for the
     log-odds. glmnet(..., family = 'multinomial') fits a symmetric
     multinomial model, where each class is represented by a linear model
     (on the log-scale). The penalties take care of redundancies. A
     two-class "multinomial" model will produce the same fit as the
     corresponding "binomial" model, except the pair of coefficient
     matrices will be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, and half the
     "binomial" values. Note that the objective function for
     "gaussian" is 
                 1 / (2 * nobs) RSS + lambda * penalty
     , and for the logistic models it is 
                 1 / nobs - loglik + lambda * penalty
